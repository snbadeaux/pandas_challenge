Module 4 Pandas Library  Challenge-School District Analysis

The challenge was to analyze two CSV files, school data, and student data, in order to conclude whether there are any significant differences with respect to school type, student population, total spending, spending per student, and grades within the schools against the passing rates for reading, math, and overall performance. Full instructions are provided in the Instructions file.


Analysis:

- In general, the per-student spending had an inverse relationship with the overall passing rate.
- Along the same lines, schools with higher budgets did not yield higher test results.
- Generally, the smaller the school, the better the performance concerning passing rates.
- Little effect, on passing, was seen between the grades within the schools.
- Charter schools had significantly better performance rates compared to District schools, as seen in the top 5 schools vs the bottom 5 schools, and the type summary data frame.
